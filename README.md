# Deep-SeSMo

Deep-SeSMo (Deep learning-based senescence scoring system by morphology) is a label-free quantitative scoring system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to evaluate the state of cellular senescence from microscopic phase-contrast images

## Description

Deep-SeSMo enable to make quantitative senescence score of cellular senescence only from microscopic phase-contrast images in cultured cells, and can be applied to high-throughput drug screening.
